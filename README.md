Weather and climate conditions play a crucial role in how we grow our food. Ensuring that crops are planted in the proper conditions is the key to a healthy harvest. Farmer's Friend is a tool for farmers (both big and small) to find out about the local climate and soil conditions. Using nature's variables such as TEMPERATURE, SOIL MOISTURE, HUMIDITY, and UVI index, Farmer's Freind takes your current location and lets you know what vegetables are best suited for your area.
